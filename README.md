# Sea Swift and Sun

## Overview

This project involves evolving an existing iOS app initially built using UIKit. The goal is to integrate SwiftUI gradually while maintaining the original codebase. The project is segmented into versions (V1 to V9), each addressing specific improvements and new features requested by the client.

## Brief Description

This project aims to enhance an existing iOS application by transitioning from UIKit to SwiftUI while introducing new features, improving the user interface, and ensuring seamless integration with backend databases and external APIs. It involves iterative development cycles focused on delivering stable versions, incorporating user feedback, and ensuring consistent communication within the team and with the client.

## Versions Overview

- **V1: Database Integration**
  - Connect the app to the provided database to replace mock data.
  - Use a pre-prod database to avoid interfering with live data.

- **V2: UI Enhancement - Detail Page**
  - Modify the detail page to improve its design and functionality within UIKit guidelines.
  - Flexibility allowed for design and color choices.

- **V3: Map-based View Integration**
  - Implement a card-based view using MapKit alongside the existing list view.
  - Integrate a picker/segmented control to switch between views.

- **V4: Account Management**
  - Incorporate Google or Apple sign-in to secure and manage user accounts.

- **V5: Form Submission and API Integration**
  - Create an interface for adding new spots via a form.
  - Implement POST API call to update the database, considering data compatibility.

- **V6: Widget Implementation**
  - Develop a widget to display a random spot daily to engage users.
  - Consider potential monetization through increased user engagement.

- **V7: Face ID Integration**
  - Add Face ID for easier reconnection/authentication.

- **V8: Weather Integration**
  - Display weather information using WeatherKit on the detail page for each spot.

- **V9: Open for New Features**
  - Client open to new feature proposals to enhance the application further.
